### What is Process Scheduling?
#### Process scheduling allows OS to allocate a time interval of CPU execution for each process. Another important reason for using a process scheduling system is that it keeps the CPU busy all the time. This allows you to get the minimum response time for programs or maximum efficiency from the CPU. Various algorithms are used based on the scenario in which the OS is designed to be used.
